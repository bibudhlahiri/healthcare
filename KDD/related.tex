Awareness about the US healthcare expenditure, as well as initiatives to contain it, are on rise. Researchers are analyzing various data sources that include, but are not limited to: structured and unstructured electronic health record (EHR), genomic data (DNA sequences), behavior data (mobility sensor data, social network data). Organizations are arranging competitions to foster innovation. To reduce the expenditure arising from unnecessary hospital admissions, the Heritage Health Prize \cite{hhp} presented the challenge of predicting, based on historical healthcare data, how many days a patient will spend in hospitals in the next year. Since traumatic head injury is a common problem encountered by athletes, GE and NFL created together the Head Health Challenge \cite{hhc} to encourage innovations that can protect the brain from traumatic injury. Automatically extracting dianosis codes from clinical text is another active area of research - it is important for decision making based on a patient's condition as documented in free-form notes, and the cost is approximately \$25 billion per year in the US \cite{siam-health}. Meystre {\em et al} \cite{MSKH08} present an overview of recent research in extracting information from textual documents in the EHRs. Negation detection and temporality analysis are some of the other areas of major interest, and NegExpander \cite{AFC99}, NegEx \cite{Chapman01}, NegFinder \cite{MDN01}, TimeText \cite{ZPH07} and Context \cite{CCD07} are some of the systems that have been developed out of research in these areas.
